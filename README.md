# s_menu
A system and utility menu extension for GNOME

This creates a menu button on the left side of your panel with access to a few
utilities. Right now this is more proof of concept than a full featured extension.

What I have done so far is thanks to the poppy menu extension which can be
downloaded at https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1279/poppy-menu/
and Just Perfections extension tutorials which can be found at
https://gitlab.com/justperfection.channel and https://youtu.be/iMyR5lJf7dU

If pamac is not installed on your system the Add/Remove software link will not
work

I tried to add a sleep command using systemcntl but gnome didn't like it. 
Is there another way to sleep the system?

Thanks for trying the extension. If you have any ideas or suggestions for
improvement please open an issue. Pull request are also welcome.
